                        In iOS 7, Apple introduced the possibility to [execute JavaScript via the JavaScriptCore JavaScript engine]
                        (http://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/). Unfortunately, JavaScriptCore is missing some objects and functions a browser
                        JavaScript environment would have. Especially the methods described in the [WindowTimers specification]
                        (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#windowtimers), such as `setTimeout` or `setInterval` are not
                        provided. This library implements those methods, so it is possible to use JavaScript libraries which were originally
                        developed for in-browser use in your Objective-C (or Swift) application without the need to use a hidden WebView.
